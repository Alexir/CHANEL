TPCCHT-000004-15,agent_2,yeah good point . he also invented some women ' s names,2,3
TPCCHT-000004-16,agent_1,"yes among those are olivia , miranda and jessica",4,5
TPCCHT-000004-17,agent_2,yeah . did you know that his works have to stick to the old english language to make sense ?,4,3
TPCCHT-000004-18,agent_1,"yes especially with punk and rhymes , they do not work with modern language",2,3
TPCCHT-000004-19,agent_2,yeah . did you know tchaikozsky donated his skull in hopes it will be used in shakespeare ' s plays ?,3,2
TPCCHT-000004-20,agent_1,yes and did get used so that is good . nice chat,4,3
TPCCHT-000005-0,agent_1,"hi , do you use google much ?",-1,0
TPCCHT-000005-1,agent_2,"yes , i think it is the most effective search engine . how about you ? do you use gmail ?",-1,0
TPCCHT-000005-2,agent_1,yes . a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon,2,3
TPCCHT-000005-3,agent_2,and before on google moon they used to use cheese for close ups !,1,3
TPCCHT-000005-4,agent_1,do you know how google maps calculates traffic ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000005-5,agent_2,"i am not sure , how do they do this ?",4,3
TPCCHT-000005-6,agent_1,they track how fast android devices are moving,4,3
TPCCHT-000005-7,agent_2,interesting ! google really is taking over the world . their data center electricity use is 0 . 01 percent of all worldwide electricity .,1,5
TPCCHT-000005-8,agent_1,yes for sure they are . they have grown so much over the years,4,3
TPCCHT-000005-9,agent_2,but i like that they like to have fun too . have you ever typed askew into google ?,3,2
TPCCHT-000005-10,agent_1,no i have . what does the results turn ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000005-11,agent_2,you should try it ! it tilts the page . another fun thing google does is call new employees nogglers . they have to wear propeller beanies . or is this mean ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000005-12,agent_1,"oh , not sure about that really . people say it is a great place to work at though",4,3
TPCCHT-000005-13,agent_2,"before google launched gmail , that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield ' s website . that actually seems more fun .",1,2
TPCCHT-000005-14,agent_1,i know now everytime i open gmail i think of garfield,4,5
TPCCHT-000005-15,agent_2,"speaking of cats , i would love to get a glow in the dark one . they have those in south korea .",3,2
TPCCHT-000005-16,agent_1,wow . in japana and taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them,4,4
TPCCHT-000005-17,agent_2,that seems fun ! that reminds me of the anderson house bed and breakfast in minnesota . they used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room .,4,4
TPCCHT-000005-18,agent_1,wow . there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat,1,3
TPCCHT-000005-19,agent_2,"that is cool . cats are a pretty smart species . there has not been a cat species extinction in 10 , 000 years .",4,4
TPCCHT-000005-20,agent_1,they are indeed very smart and that proves it . nice chatting with you .,4,2
TPCCHT-000006-0,agent_1,do you like comic books ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000006-1,agent_2,i do like comic books !,-1,0
TPCCHT-000006-2,agent_1,have you heard that harley quinn has a new comic book series coming out ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000006-3,agent_2,"i have not heard that . i know that comic book legend stan lee used to end every phone conversation with "" excelsior ! """,4,4
TPCCHT-000006-4,agent_1,i ' ve heard that too . did you know that the dc in dc comics stands for detective comics ?,4,5
TPCCHT-000006-5,agent_2,i just read that today . the largest comic book market is in japan . i believe it . my son loves to read those mangas .,3,3
TPCCHT-000006-6,agent_1,i would love to go there . i used to like reading manga too .,4,5
TPCCHT-000006-7,agent_2,the manga market is japan is valued at $ 6 to $ 7 billion dollars !,4,4
TPCCHT-000006-8,agent_1,that is wild ! did you know that michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world ?,4,3
TPCCHT-000006-9,agent_2,"i didn ' t know that . i wonder how many people use it . by comparison to japan , the us comic book market in the us and canada is $ 1 . 09 billion !",4,3
TPCCHT-000006-10,agent_1,"that ' s crazy , japan is way more into comic books than america it seems .",3,2
TPCCHT-000006-11,agent_2,"i agree ! the marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth - 199999 , a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse , earth - 616 !",1,2
TPCCHT-000006-12,agent_1,"that ' s pretty wild . marvel published a "" generic comic book , "" in order to trademark the names "" superhero "" and "" super - villain . "" that was pretty smart of them .",1,3
TPCCHT-000006-13,agent_2,no doubt ! do you know much about the planets or the universe ?,3,2
TPCCHT-000006-14,agent_1,i know a little bit . i ' ve heard that venus does not tilt .,4,4
TPCCHT-000006-15,agent_2,that interesting . uranus is different to . it actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets .,4,4
TPCCHT-000006-16,agent_1,that ' s really interesting . i ' ve also heard that jupiter ' s moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun .,4,5
TPCCHT-000006-17,agent_2,it must be pretty big then ! i wouldn ' t want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph !,1,4
TPCCHT-000006-18,agent_1,i don ' t see that being a pleasant place . it ' s even 2000 degree weather . that sounds like hell to me !,4,3
TPCCHT-000006-19,agent_2,hahah that ' s a good way of putting it !,4,3
TPCCHT-000006-20,agent_1,"well i have to get to work , i hope you have a good day . it was nice chatting with you !",1,3
TPCCHT-000007-0,agent_1,can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? the universe is so diverse .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000007-1,agent_2,its amazing and ever evolving .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000007-2,agent_1,yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away .,4,5
TPCCHT-000007-3,agent_2,they are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see,3,3
TPCCHT-000007-4,agent_1,"yes that is what i was saying , albeit i doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say .",4,3
TPCCHT-000007-5,agent_2,i don ' t see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure .,4,3
TPCCHT-000007-6,agent_1,"yeah , but only one ? for all the universe ? it does not seems logic . . .",4,3
TPCCHT-000007-7,agent_2,there is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000007-8,agent_1,"because an electron is part of matter , the water you drink , the chair you sit on . saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread .",4,4
TPCCHT-000007-9,agent_2,it makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big .,4,4
TPCCHT-000007-10,agent_1,maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?,4,3
TPCCHT-000007-11,agent_2,"i don ' t know but i am at the end of knowledge on this subject . what do you think about the facts of comics ? i would have thought us invented them , but it ' s japan or uk .",4,2
TPCCHT-000007-12,agent_1,"japan has a great printing history , i am not surprised about this . do you read comics books ? i have read a few but not about super - heroes .",4,3
TPCCHT-000007-13,agent_2,"i used to in my childhood but not any more , i used to love inspector gadget .",4,4
TPCCHT-000007-14,agent_1,was inspect gadget a comics on paper or a cartoon on tv ? i was talking about what marvel is publishing .,4,4
TPCCHT-000007-15,agent_2,on paper and yes i do recall seeing super - hero and hulk books .,4,3
TPCCHT-000007-16,agent_1,"i think that hulk is in the marvel universe . but like i said , i never read anything from marvel nor dc comics .",4,3
TPCCHT-000007-17,agent_2,"right me neither , there were so many good choices of comics when i was growing up .",4,5
TPCCHT-000007-18,agent_1,"not where i lived , if i want to read a comic book , i had to go to the library . but as i think about it tintin is a comic book , so i was wrong , i did read a lot of them when i was young but they were european .",4,4
TPCCHT-000007-19,agent_2,"mine all time favorite was bozo the clown , books and tv both .",4,3
TPCCHT-000007-20,agent_1,"i did saw a lot of cartoons on tv , but i don ' t think that considered as a comic book . have a nice day .",4,3
TPCCHT-000008-0,agent_1,are you a star wars fan ? i need to rewatch the ot and the prequels so i can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what ' s going on .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000008-1,agent_2,"hi ! yes , i am a huge fan of star wars ! i also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in navajo ! i think that is so cool !",-1,0
TPCCHT-000008-2,agent_1,"yeah , that ' s wild . i guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work .",1,3
TPCCHT-000008-3,agent_2,"agreed . isn ' t it also funny james earl jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for darth vader ? i also can ' t believe he was only paid $ 7500 ! geez , that ' s pocket change .",1,3
TPCCHT-000008-4,agent_1,$ 7500 is amazingly low . i guess since darth vader was masked jones could just record everything at once in the studio .,4,4
TPCCHT-000008-5,agent_2,"agreed . can you also believe that george lucas ' wife at the time , marcia , won an academy award for her editing on star wars and yet george lucas didn ' t win an academy award for directing . that is just downright unbelievable !",4,3
TPCCHT-000008-6,agent_1,a lot of people think the ot was so much better than the prequels because of her influence .,4,3
TPCCHT-000008-7,agent_2,"yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like leia ' s good luck kiss , obi wan ' s death , etc . she was truly a big influence !",4,3
TPCCHT-000008-8,agent_1,"i remember thinking just about everything in the prequels ' timeline was off , based on the mental version of the past the ot led us to construct . but i ' d have to rewatch to nail it down .",2,2
TPCCHT-000008-9,agent_2,yeah i would have to watch it as well ! so are you also a fan of chewbacca ? i love him . i think it ' s funny there ' s a bat species called the chewbacca bat . that ' s hilarious !,4,3
TPCCHT-000008-10,agent_1,i never felt strongly about chewbacca one way or the other tbh . but i ' ve got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like !,4,4
TPCCHT-000008-11,agent_2,i would like to see it as well . did you know chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys ? that ' s pretty interesting !,4,3
TPCCHT-000008-12,agent_1,i vaguely recall reading something in the star wars fictional universe where a young han solo stayed with chewbacca and his mom in their home .,1,4
TPCCHT-000008-13,agent_2,"that ' s so weird , isn ' t it ? ha ! are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and chewbacca were secret rebel agents ? i kind of think it ' s an interesting theory .",4,4
TPCCHT-000008-14,agent_1,"i wish i knew enough about the background to have an opinion , but the last star wars i watched was episode iii , when it came out on video . i really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it .",4,3
TPCCHT-000008-15,agent_2,"same here ! like , i also had forgotten that before his companionship with chewbacca , hans solo was an imperial lieutenant !",3,3
TPCCHT-000008-16,agent_1,"yeah , i don ' t remember that at all . he definitely doesn ' t seem like the type .",1,4
TPCCHT-000008-17,agent_2,"indeed he doesn ' t . but i ' ve always liked chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog . ha ! speaking of dogs , i think it ' s cool that dogs , along with elephants , are the only animals that understand pointing !",4,3
TPCCHT-000008-18,agent_1,"i wouldn ' t be surprised if cats understood it but just didn ' t care , lol .",4,4
TPCCHT-000008-19,agent_2,"ha ! no kidding . speaking of dogs and cats , i like how google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they ' re a dog company ! that is awesome !",3,1
TPCCHT-000008-20,agent_1,"yeah , that ' s a weird official policy for what ' s supposed to be a neutral search engine ! nice chatting with you .",1,2
TPCCHT-000009-0,agent_1,"naming a cloned cat "" copy cat "" , that ' s cute .",-1,0
TPCCHT-000009-1,agent_2,you must have esp . i was going to tell you teh same thing ! i have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in asia than as pets in the us .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000009-2,agent_1,really ? that ' s awful to hear !,3,2
TPCCHT-000009-3,agent_2,of roosevelt ' s 20 pets two were a bear and hyena !,3,3
TPCCHT-000009-4,agent_1,"whoa , cool ! i know he seemed to be quite the animal lover .",3,2
TPCCHT-000009-5,agent_2,"and there are more pets in japan than there are children under 15 . you can ' t be a pets "" owner "" in boulder but you can be their guardian .",2,3
TPCCHT-000009-6,agent_1,i have a pet . i am an ailurophile meaning i love cats .,1,2
TPCCHT-000009-7,agent_2,cool word ! did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on earth ?,4,3
TPCCHT-000009-8,agent_1,that is a lot ! and in 2002 germany gave them legal rights .,3,2
TPCCHT-000009-9,agent_2,"yeah , and the loch ness monster is protected under the 1912 scottish animal protection act .",3,2
TPCCHT-000009-10,agent_1,i wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting . . . being immortal and all .,4,3
TPCCHT-000009-11,agent_2,"lol . . . speaking of water animals , did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills ?",3,2
TPCCHT-000009-12,agent_1,"maybe that connection is part of why 84 % of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish , too . . . hmm .",4,4
TPCCHT-000009-13,agent_2,hmm ? good theory . seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals .,2,3
TPCCHT-000009-14,agent_1,"well , they are good at helping people adjust to new situations , too .",4,4
TPCCHT-000009-15,agent_2,"yes , like for elderly who are without companions .",4,3
TPCCHT-000009-16,agent_1,"or people with anxiety and depression , or kids with autism .",4,3
TPCCHT-000009-17,agent_2,"yes , a seahorse wouldn ' t be very good for that purpose . did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck ?",1,3
TPCCHT-000009-18,agent_1,i don ' t think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length !,3,2
TPCCHT-000009-19,agent_2,that would freak me out ! but i bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication !,4,3
TPCCHT-000009-20,agent_1,could be . fish are cool like that . i think it ' s neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish .,1,2
TPCCHT-000009-21,agent_2,i wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000009-22,agent_1,"that would be a good thing to know , especially because some of them make good pets .",2,2
TPCCHT-000009-23,agent_2,"yep , but i don ' t know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog",4,4
TPCCHT-000009-24,agent_1,probably not . dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time .,3,3
TPCCHT-000009-25,agent_2,"hey , did you know the first marine predator was the shark ? they developed in the silurian period .",1,2
TPCCHT-000009-26,agent_1,very interesting . i wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then . . .,4,3
TPCCHT-000009-27,agent_2,or have evolved into other species . the shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer .,4,2
TPCCHT-000009-28,agent_1,that makes sense . i always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone .,4,4
TPCCHT-000009-29,agent_2,"yes , fascinating fact ! tuna also hold a higher core temperature . they are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers .",1,4
TPCCHT-000009-30,agent_1,"tuna can get quite large , too . it ' s cool how big some fish get .",4,3
TPCCHT-000009-31,agent_2,one more before we go . . . did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead ?,3,3
TPCCHT-000009-32,agent_1,yeah . that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild .,4,5
TPCCHT-000009-33,agent_2,very cool chatting with you . did you know there are 6331 groups of genes ? they are common to all living animals !,3,3
TPCCHT-000009-34,agent_1,it was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you .,4,3
TPCCHT-000010-0,agent_1,i think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the dear amy section .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000010-1,agent_2,that is sad . do you have pets ? the first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000010-2,agent_1,"yes , i have a dog . sounds like in the dear amy that they do everything tit for tat . the cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat . that ' s not necessarily fair though i don ' t think . they seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future .",4,3
TPCCHT-000010-3,agent_2,yeah that ' s a bit dramatic ! a cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile .,3,4
TPCCHT-000010-4,agent_1,allergies can be serious to people . i understand his reserve of having a cat .,2,2
TPCCHT-000010-5,agent_2,"me too . a pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person ' s company , protection , or entertainment . no one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house .",4,4
TPCCHT-000010-6,agent_1,"i ' m sure she loves the pet , but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance .",3,2
TPCCHT-000010-7,agent_2,over 1 . 5 million living animal species have been described . i ' m sure they can find one to agree on .,3,2
TPCCHT-000010-8,agent_1,did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated ? that ' s a new one to me .,1,4
TPCCHT-000010-9,agent_2,"that ' s interesting ! of the 1 . 5 million species , 1 million are insects ! yuck !",1,5
TPCCHT-000010-10,agent_1,"apparently , there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal . if you want to live forever , you can look into being a jellyfish .",2,2
TPCCHT-000010-11,agent_2,"fascinating ! in japan , there are more pets than there are children under 15 .",1,3
TPCCHT-000010-12,agent_1,"teddy roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real "" teddy "" bear along with a hyena",3,3
TPCCHT-000010-13,agent_2,wow ! there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia .,4,4
TPCCHT-000010-14,agent_1,"i never met anyone with a tiger pet . that is strange . it ' s not legal to own pets in boulder , colorado but you can be their guardian .",4,4
TPCCHT-000010-15,agent_2,"lots of places have special animal rights . in 2002 , germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally - guaranteed legal rights .",3,3
TPCCHT-000010-16,agent_1,the loch ness monster is protected by 1912 scottish provisions,1,4
TPCCHT-000010-17,agent_2,that ' s funny . it ' s not even a proven species . there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth .,4,3
TPCCHT-000010-18,agent_1,did you ever hear of people being contacted due to dna matches ? you can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members,1,3
TPCCHT-000010-19,agent_2,"that is pretty cool . there are several companies offering dna testing , and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy",4,4
TPCCHT-000010-20,agent_1,dna matches could be connected via social media .,3,3
TPCCHT-000011-0,agent_1,"hi , do you like fish ?",-1,0
TPCCHT-000011-1,agent_2,"yes , i love fish do you ?",-1,0
TPCCHT-000011-2,agent_1,yes me too . some of them can eat prey twice their sizew,4,3
TPCCHT-000011-3,agent_2,"yes , did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck ?",4,3
TPCCHT-000011-4,agent_1,"that is so cool , and the males carry the young in that species",3,3
TPCCHT-000011-5,agent_2,"yes , and zebrafish are very interesting .",3,4
TPCCHT-000011-6,agent_1,yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves,1,2
TPCCHT-000011-7,agent_2,"yes interesting , how about the first cloned cat named copy cat ?",2,2
TPCCHT-000011-8,agent_1,that is cool . there is a jellyfish that is immortal,1,2
TPCCHT-000011-9,agent_2,"i know , really ? how about our hiccups are from gills and lungs ?",3,4
TPCCHT-000011-10,agent_1,"that is a such a cool fact , we are still evolving so maybe it will eventually go away",3,2
TPCCHT-000011-11,agent_2,"lol , interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species .",2,3
TPCCHT-000011-12,agent_1,yet no one has really seen it to confirm its existence,1,4
TPCCHT-000011-13,agent_2,"i know , also , i do believe in japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets .",2,3
TPCCHT-000011-14,agent_1,do you know how many idnividual animals are believed to be on earth ?,2,2
TPCCHT-000011-15,agent_2,"yes , 20 quintillion , can you believe that ? wow",4,4
TPCCHT-000011-16,agent_1,i do not even know how many zeros are in that number,4,4
TPCCHT-000011-17,agent_2,"lol , i know , i guess the us have more tigers as pets than living wild in asia .",2,3
TPCCHT-000011-18,agent_1,and roosevelet did not have any of them,2,4
TPCCHT-000011-19,agent_2,he did have a bear and hyena . good to know you are a guardian not an owner in colorado to pets .,2,2
TPCCHT-000011-20,agent_1,i like that too . nice chat,2,2
TPCCHT-000012-0,agent_1,hello,-1,0
TPCCHT-000012-1,agent_2,hello . do you have a cat ? i see that some people can be allergic to them .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000012-2,agent_1,"no , i do not . i am actually allergic to cats . the first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat",4,5
TPCCHT-000012-3,agent_2,"that ' s interesting and a little funny . i had no idea of this , but the cat is the most popular pet in the world . did you know that ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000012-4,agent_1,"wow , no i didn ' t know that . there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia .",3,3
TPCCHT-000012-5,agent_2,now that i had no idea of . did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets ?,1,4
TPCCHT-000012-6,agent_1,"wow , that ' s odd . two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats",1,4
TPCCHT-000012-7,agent_2,i have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite .,1,4
TPCCHT-000012-8,agent_1,dogs are my favorite also . i hope to get another one in the future .,1,2
TPCCHT-000012-9,agent_2,do you have any now ? i have two .,4,3
TPCCHT-000012-10,agent_1,"no , i do not . what kind do you have ? 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish",1,3
TPCCHT-000012-11,agent_2,i have a beagle and a border collie . i had no idea about that with the zebrafish . i wonder if cures can be found by using their genes .,3,2
TPCCHT-000012-12,agent_1,i used to have a collie named bimbo . that ' s a great question .,2,2
TPCCHT-000012-13,agent_2,mine is named cute stuff . did you know about the fish that lives on land ? i wonder what it is .,2,2
TPCCHT-000012-14,agent_1,"no , i didn ' t . there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal",2,2
TPCCHT-000012-15,agent_2,seriously ? i thought they just evaporated in the sun ?,3,2
TPCCHT-000012-16,agent_1,"absolutely , there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth .",1,4
TPCCHT-000012-17,agent_2,and who knows how many that are undiscovered . animals are truly fascinating !,4,5
TPCCHT-000012-18,agent_1,"yes , they are . in 2002 , germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally - guaranteed legal rights .",2,2
TPCCHT-000012-19,agent_2,i think that is a good thing ! i like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges .,4,4
TPCCHT-000012-20,agent_1,me too . thanks for the informative chat .,3,3
TPCCHT-000013-0,agent_1,"hello , did you know that there are over 1 . 5 million living animal species ?",-1,0
TPCCHT-000013-1,agent_2,"no , that was chock full of interesting facts . hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs ? interesting stuff .",-1,0
TPCCHT-000013-2,agent_1,"never heard that one before , lol ! there is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight .",2,3
TPCCHT-000013-3,agent_2,i knew one of those in my fraternity in college i think . i was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal . only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet .,3,5
TPCCHT-000013-4,agent_1,"yeah we all know that guy ! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the scottish 1912 protection of animals act . creatures of the great deep are extraordinary . "" the immortal jelly fish .",3,5
TPCCHT-000013-5,agent_2,"i already looked up that jellyfish on my phone . fascinating , yes loch ness is protected and pets in boulder , colorado are not owned , but guarded . interesting how different cultures handle that .",4,3
TPCCHT-000013-6,agent_1,tell me about it apparently there are more u . s . tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in asia .,2,2
TPCCHT-000013-7,agent_2,"yes , that is sad in some ways too . happy we ' re keeping them alive , probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today .",4,4
TPCCHT-000013-8,agent_1,i agree . germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally - guaranteed rights .,1,3
TPCCHT-000013-9,agent_2,"while i ' m a pet owner , that going a bit far . do you give dogs and cats rights , how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten . do they get lesser rights ?",4,3
TPCCHT-000013-10,agent_1,very good point . my wife and i are watching blue planet . it ' s shocking some of the things that are down in the deep . they are still making discoveries every single day . apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck .,1,4
TPCCHT-000013-11,agent_2,"yes , and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean . who knows what ' s down there we don ' t know ? maybe the loch ness monster ' s cousin .",4,4
TPCCHT-000013-12,agent_1,"if you ever get a chance you should check this show , there ' s some amazing creatures down there . 84 % of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish .",2,2
TPCCHT-000013-13,agent_2,i read that and thought the same . i wonder how similar the zebra fish is to humans ? can we use that in medical research ?,3,2
TPCCHT-000013-14,agent_1,"if we can i ' m sure it will be preventative or medication . there ' s no money in cures . i didn ' t realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it copy cat , that ' s too funny .",1,2
TPCCHT-000013-15,agent_2,"yes , the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor . related to domestication , i had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads . i wonder what causes that , it doesn ' t seem to have any evolutionary reason to me .",4,4
TPCCHT-000013-16,agent_1,sounds strange . i can ' t fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet . i ' m a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets . anything with red eyes you can keep .,2,3
TPCCHT-000013-17,agent_2,"haha , yep . a snake doesn ' t seem very warm or comforting either . i don ' t understand why people enjoy having them as pets . and how do they find partners who accept it ?",1,3
TPCCHT-000013-18,agent_1,"other people who like that stuff i guess , haha . apparently theodore roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and hyena . i wonder if he played with them much ?",4,3
TPCCHT-000013-19,agent_2,"well , president of the united states , i wonder if he had them in the white house ? did he have a stable for the bear out back ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000013-20,agent_1,some animals just should be domesticated . that white patch if true is something to ponder .,2,3
TPCCHT-000013-21,agent_2,"yes indeed , interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend . that was an enjoyable conversation . thanks and have a lovely weekend .",4,4
TPCCHT-000013-22,agent_1,you as well ! !,1,4
TPCCHT-000013-23,agent_2,thanks .,1,3
TPCCHT-000014-0,agent_1,"hey hows it going , do you know what the first cloned animal was ?",-1,0
TPCCHT-000014-1,agent_2,"was it a sheep ? i heard the first cloned pet was a cat , though . its name was copy cat . that is funny !",-1,0
TPCCHT-000014-2,agent_1,"haha ya i like that , what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia",3,3
TPCCHT-000014-3,agent_2,"wow , that is weird and sad . speaking of which , did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000014-4,agent_1,"no that is really sad , poor tiger what happened to it ? why was it in a bag ?",4,5
TPCCHT-000014-5,agent_2,i guess it was being smuggled to the usa from mexico .,4,4
TPCCHT-000014-6,agent_1,"ya i don ' t like that that makes me mad , do you have any pets ? i guess in japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen",2,2
TPCCHT-000014-7,agent_2,"they really love their pets huh ? no , i don ' t have any pets . do you ?",4,2
TPCCHT-000014-8,agent_1,"no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away , we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such",4,4
TPCCHT-000014-9,agent_2,"in boulder , colorado you cannot own a pet . you can be their guardian though .",4,3
TPCCHT-000014-10,agent_1,"hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words , do you like teddy roosevelt ? apparently he had over 20 pets , or as they say in colorado , "" guardians "" haha",2,2
TPCCHT-000014-11,agent_2,"maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets . shrug . yeah , teddy roosevelt is an interesting guy . it ' s unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned . many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger .",4,3
TPCCHT-000014-12,agent_1,"ya that makes me really sad , what do you think about fish ? i had salmon for dinner so i do think theyre tasty haha",2,2
TPCCHT-000014-13,agent_2,haha . funny . i don ' t eat seafood . my mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when i was little and i grew sick of it . haha # firstworldproblems .,4,5
TPCCHT-000014-14,agent_1,"haha ya , well i am like the black swallower fish , i could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because i love it",1,3
TPCCHT-000014-15,agent_2,funny . i would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal .,1,4
TPCCHT-000014-16,agent_1,i know they need to apply those genes to me ! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck,2,3
TPCCHT-000014-17,agent_2,so seahorses are salt water right ? i guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin .,4,3
TPCCHT-000014-18,agent_1,"yes that would be true , also true is that 84 % of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish , we need to study that fish too !",4,4
TPCCHT-000014-19,agent_2,how odd ! do you think the loch ness monster is real ? it is a protected species !,3,3
TPCCHT-000014-20,agent_1,"haha i wish it were real ! that ' s funny they did that in 1912 , maybe they knew something that we dont ?",1,2
TPCCHT-000015-0,agent_1,what would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000015-1,agent_2,"i would look around to make sure mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with , "" gimme back my child "" look !",-1,0
TPCCHT-000015-2,agent_1,"lol yep you don ' t want to be around an angry tiger mom haha . i guess they found one on the southern border in texas , a bag with a baby tiger that is",4,4
TPCCHT-000015-3,agent_2,was it a smuggling thing ?,1,3
TPCCHT-000015-4,agent_1,yes i think so unfortunately . the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately,4,5
TPCCHT-000015-5,agent_2,"with 20 quintillion animals in this world , why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000015-6,agent_1,"haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts , i don ' t think a mosquito is worth anything lol . why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads ?",4,3
TPCCHT-000015-7,agent_2,"once domesticated , animals develop white patches on their foreheads , likely because once indoors , they run into painted walls and doors with their heads . i know i do .",1,4
TPCCHT-000015-8,agent_1,haha i wonder if humans developed these white patches as well . what do you think about germany giving constitutional rights to animals ? they did that back in 2002,3,2
TPCCHT-000015-9,agent_2,"i think german constitutional right for animals are pretty cool . pretty , pretty . i learned about that while watching the german remake of the classic film , "" 12 angry hamsters """,4,3
TPCCHT-000015-10,agent_1,"well i ' ll have to watch that movie . i just think it ' s cool that hiccups are relics of when animals had both lungs and gills , so next time you have the hiccups think about that lol",3,3
TPCCHT-000015-11,agent_2,does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de - evolve ? maybe that is what happened to the loch ness monster ! i ' m glad she is a protected species . hate to think someone might bag aunt matilda .,2,2
TPCCHT-000015-12,agent_1,"it ' s funny that it ' s protected by 1912 scottish law , the "" protection of animals act "" . hopefully that means that it ' s a real animal lol but i doubt it",2,2
TPCCHT-000015-13,agent_2,"yeah . aunt matilda would make a better hag fish anyway , or maybe a seahorse , since they are the only fish with a neck .",3,4
TPCCHT-000015-14,agent_1,that is crazy ! i also think it ' s crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die aka its immortal,4,3
TPCCHT-000015-15,agent_2,"does that mean they never get cancer , or they get cancer forever ? you know , 84 % of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish , but i have never seen a zebrafish with ms or parkinson ' s disease . . .",4,3
TPCCHT-000015-16,agent_1,"haha i haven ' t seen it either ! maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease , because black swallow fish can eat prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha",3,3
TPCCHT-000015-17,agent_2,"haha . if freshwater fish can drink through it ' s skin , why don ' t you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita ?",2,3
TPCCHT-000015-18,agent_1,haha i wish i could drink through my skin and float in a margarita lol . do you have any pets by the way ?,3,2
TPCCHT-000015-19,agent_2,"too many to count . we ' ve had hamsters , snakes , scorpions , lizards , fish , cats , dogs , chickens , birds . . . our apartment is getting cramped . . .",1,3
TPCCHT-000015-20,agent_1,"haha that ' s a lot of animals ! we have a dog actually , but i can ' t believe that there are more pet tigers in the usa than wild ones in asia , a lot of people must have illegal pets here",4,3
TPCCHT-000016-0,agent_1,can you recommend any movies to watch ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000016-1,agent_2,do you like star wars ? the movie about hans solo just came out on netflix .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000016-2,agent_1,is that the one where its about a young han solo ?,4,3
TPCCHT-000016-3,agent_2,"yeah it is the one , so han solo is not played by harrison ford , does it affect your opinion of the movie ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000016-4,agent_1,someone else can fill harrison fords shoes ? maybe ill check into how well this alden guy does in the role,4,4
TPCCHT-000016-5,agent_2,"he did a good job , but han solo was already young in the 1977 movie , i think it impacted negatively the movie .",4,3
TPCCHT-000016-6,agent_1,does chewbacca appear in this movie ?,4,2
TPCCHT-000016-7,agent_2,"yes it does , but it is not the same actor who did the other movies . i don ' t think that matters too much .",1,3
TPCCHT-000016-8,agent_1,i like their relationshop in the movies . chewy is a very loyal friend,1,3
TPCCHT-000016-9,agent_2,in the canon chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons .,3,3
TPCCHT-000016-10,agent_1,thats interesting . i heard george rr martin had an illustration that chewie is based off of,3,2
TPCCHT-000016-11,agent_2,"i heard that too , it was on the cover of one of his small stories . it is a peculiar creature when you think about it .",4,4
TPCCHT-000016-12,agent_1,i wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with martins help . there ' s a giant fictional universe that could be filled .,4,4
TPCCHT-000016-13,agent_2,would you like to see a film with chewbacca as the principal character ?,1,3
TPCCHT-000016-14,agent_1,i think it would be interesting . there are also so many comic stories that could be told . i just wonder how communication would work in such a movie,4,4
TPCCHT-000016-15,agent_2,"they would use subtitles . and good storytelling , like how hans solo seems to understand chewie ' s intentions , but not his words .",4,5
TPCCHT-000016-16,agent_1,yeah its like having a dog as a best friend . but able to shoot things,2,2
TPCCHT-000016-17,agent_2,there was also a dog movie that opened this summer a . x . l . about a robot dog .,2,2
TPCCHT-000016-18,agent_1,i will have to check that one out as well . thanks for your time . have a good day,4,4
TPCCHT-000016-19,agent_2,"do you like dogs ? i love them , they were one of the first domesticated animals .",4,3
TPCCHT-000016-20,agent_1,yes ! dogs and elephants can understand pointing,3,3
TPCCHT-000017-0,agent_1,good morning ! how are you today ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000017-1,agent_2,"well , you may be on the other side of the fence but i like neither kanye nor trump .",-1,0
TPCCHT-000017-2,agent_1,i couldn ' t have said it any better lol . that was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago !,4,3
TPCCHT-000017-3,agent_2,"i recall the time that kanye stood up to a president when he perceived racism , now he seems to have flipped . i guess they money makes a big difference ,",4,5
TPCCHT-000017-4,agent_1,a very big difference . he even thinks aids is a man - made disease !,4,3
TPCCHT-000017-5,agent_2,"people love a good conspiracy story . i think that is how trump does so well , people believe in the deep state , and such .",4,3
TPCCHT-000017-6,agent_1,i agree ! what kind of music do you like to listen to ?,1,2
TPCCHT-000017-7,agent_2,"i ' m a kid of the eighties and nineties , i never really moved on from that alternative rock scene .",4,4
TPCCHT-000017-8,agent_1,same here ! i think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh ?,1,2
TPCCHT-000017-9,agent_2,"there has been the odd rap song that i like , but for me it ' s cultural . i ' m just not from the environment most rappers are and can ' t appreciate their point of view .",1,3
TPCCHT-000017-10,agent_1,i agree too ! i can ' t believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha .,2,1
TPCCHT-000017-11,agent_2,"that ' s kind of cool , i like it when people don ' t take themselves too seriously . like when kanye made fun of himself on snl . if only he ' d do it more .",4,5
TPCCHT-000017-12,agent_1,"all he has to do is talk and it happens haha . i give him props though , he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert . however , i ' m sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too . . . . .",1,3
TPCCHT-000017-13,agent_2,"funny . are you one for hats ? probably not a maga hat , but hat ' s in general ?",1,4
TPCCHT-000017-14,agent_1,"i wear hats when i ' m out hiking , but that is about it , how about you ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000017-15,agent_2,"generally not . i ' m originally from the uk so i guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat , but never really worn any type of hat .",4,3
TPCCHT-000017-16,agent_1,it took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now i know . wasn ' t that the most popular hat in the old west too ?,4,3
TPCCHT-000017-17,agent_2,"i ' m guessing that is because of tv and movies , we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different . being self deprecating , i ' d say a dunces cap suits me well .",4,3
TPCCHT-000017-18,agent_1,well said ! i think it suits me well too haha . that is where the conical party hat was derived from !,3,2
TPCCHT-000017-19,agent_2,or maybe we could give it to mr west next time he wants to speak his mind to us .,1,2
TPCCHT-000017-20,agent_1,"or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is . anyways , i had a great chat with you , have an awesome day !",4,4
TPCCHT-000018-0,agent_1,do you like wearing hats ? it has so many functions !,-1,0
TPCCHT-000018-1,agent_2,i don ' t like them on myself but i know a lot of people that can pull them off .,-1,0
TPCCHT-000018-2,agent_1,"yes me as well . in the military hats denote a nationality , branch of service , rank or regiment .",4,4
TPCCHT-000018-3,agent_2,i noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank .,4,4
TPCCHT-000018-4,agent_1,"yes they have a function to play . in the old west , the most popular hat was the bowler !",4,2
TPCCHT-000018-5,agent_2,wow ! they always show a stetson or something close so i ' m shocked by that .,2,2
TPCCHT-000018-6,agent_1,yes me as well ! tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors . very chivalry of them !,3,2
TPCCHT-000018-7,agent_2,that ' s a very interesting fact . did you know that until 1998 british politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order ?,4,3
TPCCHT-000018-8,agent_1,oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition . kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps !,4,4
TPCCHT-000018-9,agent_2,that ' s also a strange hat . as far as old traditions in british politics i don ' t understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either . so strange .,4,4
TPCCHT-000018-10,agent_1,agreed . they look so silly in my opinion . a lot of rapping attire looks silly too . but the rapper tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance .,3,3
TPCCHT-000018-11,agent_2,"i ' m surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest . speaking of rap , do you know what eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper ?",4,3
TPCCHT-000018-12,agent_1,i didn ' t know that . very interesting . rappers also have some odd beliefs . like kanye west who thinks aids is a man - made disease .,2,2
TPCCHT-000018-13,agent_2,eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist . kanye west is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas .,4,3
TPCCHT-000018-14,agent_1,yes he is . but he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert .,2,3
TPCCHT-000018-15,agent_2,that was nice of him . did you know that busta rhymes did voice work in an animated movie ?,1,3
TPCCHT-000018-16,agent_1,oh yeah you ' re right . he was the reptar wagon in the 1998 rugrats movie !,4,3
TPCCHT-000018-17,agent_2,yes he was . he has a distinct voice so i don ' t know how i missed it initially .,2,2
TPCCHT-000018-18,agent_1,good point . i didn ' t know rap was popular in korea . they created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle ! well thanks for talking with me today !,3,3
TPCCHT-000018-19,agent_2,i didn ' t know that either . that has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here . it was nice talking with you as well .,4,3
TPCCHT-000018-20,agent_1,yes here they are much more agressive ! have a good one !,4,4
TPCCHT-000019-0,agent_1,did you see that kanye is having another kid ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000019-1,agent_2,i heard something but i ' m not really following his offspring : ),-1,0
TPCCHT-000019-2,agent_1,i saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k . i ' d want a whole lot more than that !,4,3
TPCCHT-000019-3,agent_2,"ok , yes that ' s what i read . . . and somebody needs to explain to me , how using a surrogate really works . . .",4,4
TPCCHT-000019-4,agent_1,"simple explanation : they take egg from mom , sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person .",4,5
TPCCHT-000019-5,agent_2,ok . . . why are they doing that ? kardashian can ' t have babies ?,3,2
TPCCHT-000019-6,agent_1,"not sure to be honest , i ' d love to know too though .",3,2
TPCCHT-000019-7,agent_2,i think it ' s just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews . . . this is a crazy world . . .,4,4
TPCCHT-000019-8,agent_1,"i wouldn ' t doubt it . speaking of him , do you like rap music ? ( trying to cover the topics ! haha )",1,3
TPCCHT-000019-9,agent_2,"lol ; ) no , not really . . . i don ' t consider it to be music ; )",1,4
TPCCHT-000019-10,agent_1,i mean - i think it is definitely music . . . but i agree not my type .,2,4
TPCCHT-000019-11,agent_2,doesn ' t music needs melody ? ; ),4,3
TPCCHT-000019-12,agent_1,lots of rap does have that !,2,2
TPCCHT-000019-13,agent_2,a sample on keyboard doesn ' t count ; ),2,2
TPCCHT-000019-14,agent_1,i ' m thinking you haven ' t heard much more than whats on the radio then,4,3
TPCCHT-000019-15,agent_2,"maybe you ' re right , i don ' t want to argue ; ) not my cup of tea though : ) i ' m more of a blues fan . classic rock , maybe metal . ; )",4,5
TPCCHT-000019-16,agent_1,i ' ll pretty much listen to anything except country . it is god awful,4,3
TPCCHT-000019-17,agent_2,i don ' t listen to country but i don ' t mind it . it has it ' s own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country . . .,2,3
TPCCHT-000019-18,agent_1,i suppose . just like most music what is played on the radio is just garbage,4,3
TPCCHT-000019-19,agent_2,i agree . . . i mean i haven ' t heard anything new that ' s good . maybe except black country communion . . . great band,4,4
TPCCHT-000019-20,agent_1,can ' t say i know them !,2,3
TPCCHT-000020-0,agent_1,do you like rap music ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000020-1,agent_2,"i do , but i cannot tolerate kanye west . i adore tupac , and think it ' s interesting that the library of congress chose his music to be included because it ' s culturally significant .",-1,0
TPCCHT-000020-2,agent_1,"i agree , kanye ' s old music was really good . he ' s just out there . just like how he thinks aids is a man - made disease .",4,3
TPCCHT-000020-3,agent_2,"i just don ' t care for him . i would have loved to have been in the courtroom , the day a judge decided to give her ruling to eminem , in rap style .",4,2
TPCCHT-000020-4,agent_1,"that would have been funny . speaking of eminem , did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000020-5,agent_2,"yes , spidey is his favorite . my brother used to love rugrats when he was little , i only found out recently , that busta rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie .",3,3
TPCCHT-000020-6,agent_1,i didn ' t know that either . that ' s pretty interesting . did you know that korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle ?,3,3
TPCCHT-000020-7,agent_2,"the compliment battle , lol . i would love to hear that . i love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west , yet it was really the bowler .",1,2
TPCCHT-000020-8,agent_1,"yeah , cowboy hats were more as working hats weren ' t they ? did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons ?",1,4
TPCCHT-000020-9,agent_2,"i did not . that sounds interesting . much like the "" tip of the hat "" originates from knights raising their visors .",4,4
TPCCHT-000020-10,agent_1,that is interesting too . i heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins .,4,3
TPCCHT-000020-11,agent_2,"they did that , so they wouldn ' t be used as weapons . smart move .",4,4
TPCCHT-000020-12,agent_1,yeah it is . i ' d hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin .,4,3
TPCCHT-000020-13,agent_2,that does sound like a painful way to die . i do like the fact that kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once . he does have a few redeeming qualities .,1,3
TPCCHT-000020-14,agent_1,yeah he does have a few . he once did an snl skit mocking for interrupting awards shows . . . . 2 years before the infamous taylor swift incident .,4,3
TPCCHT-000020-15,agent_2,"i have no idea what that is , as i don ' t pay attention to her either . i still find it mindblowing that big sean turned down a scholarship to michigan , to go rap .",4,2
TPCCHT-000020-16,agent_1,"yeah that is pretty good . he made a good choice i guess , he ' s one of the biggest rappers in the world right now . he can always go back .",1,4
TPCCHT-000020-17,agent_2,"big sean is ? weird , most have never heard of him . i do like kanye ' s middle name , omari , .",4,3
TPCCHT-000020-18,agent_1,so his initials are k . o . w . that ' s funny !,1,2
TPCCHT-000020-19,agent_2,"i love the skits saturday night live does of trump . the one of brett kavanaugh was hilarious , have you seen it ?",1,3
TPCCHT-000020-20,agent_1,yes it was hilarious !,4,4
TPCCHT-000020-21,agent_2,"thank you for chatting with me , have a nice day .",4,2
TPCCHT-000020-22,agent_1,"i enjoyed it , i hope you have a nice day as well .",4,3
TPCCHT-000021-0,agent_1,hello . did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000021-1,agent_2,"haha yeah , i heard about that . it ' s been there since 1968 .",-1,0
TPCCHT-000021-2,agent_1,i guess they all like candy a lot ! at least it ' s american made . the candy is made in pennsylvania .,4,4
TPCCHT-000021-3,agent_2,what candy is made in pennsylvania besides hershey ?,1,5
TPCCHT-000021-4,agent_1,"they ' ve got milky way bars , mars bars , and even jelly beans !",3,2
TPCCHT-000021-5,agent_2,"wow , that ' s way cooler than the fact that they didn ' t let women wear pants until 1993 .",2,3
TPCCHT-000021-6,agent_1,i know . it is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor .,3,2
TPCCHT-000021-7,agent_2,"they wore pantsuits , they kept it classy . haha .",4,3
TPCCHT-000021-8,agent_1,yes they did . senate is very big on tradition . they used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked .,4,4
TPCCHT-000021-9,agent_2,"senate can be so cool , haha . did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote ? i thought that sort of things only happened on house of cards",2,2
TPCCHT-000021-10,agent_1,i have heard about that . one of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers !,4,4
TPCCHT-000021-11,agent_2,"yeah , i think that rule might be from before senators were elected . they weren ' t elected until 1913 .",2,2
TPCCHT-000021-12,agent_1,elections are a good and a bad thing . i ' ve heard somewhere that the people of ancient athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy .,2,3
TPCCHT-000021-13,agent_2,i think that might be because nobody votes . voter turn out hasn ' t gone higher than 62 % in 100 years .,4,3
TPCCHT-000021-14,agent_1,maybe some people figure there ' s no need to vote . research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway .,4,4
TPCCHT-000021-15,agent_2,we should just have people voted in by lottery . that ' s what athens used to do .,4,3
TPCCHT-000021-16,agent_1,it almost seems as if that is what we have now . i think more states than just nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots .,4,4
TPCCHT-000021-17,agent_2,"yeah , hopefully we ' ll see some electoral reform soon , hopefully we can see this will improve fairness .",3,3
TPCCHT-000021-18,agent_1,speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the uk could vote until 1918 ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000021-19,agent_2,"nope . but , i did hear that astronauts can vote from space .",1,4
TPCCHT-000021-20,agent_1,that is amazing and very determined . it ' s like india setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions !,1,4
TPCCHT-000022-0,agent_1,hi are you a fan of star wars ?,-1,0
TPCCHT-000022-1,agent_2,"my son is , so i know a little bit about it .",-1,0
TPCCHT-000022-2,agent_1,nice ! did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977 ? i remember going to the theater to see it .,4,4
TPCCHT-000022-3,agent_2,"no , i did not . my son went with his friends . apparently , star wars was dubbed in navajo in 2013 .",1,5
TPCCHT-000022-4,agent_1,there must have been a big enough market for them to do that . they have the money to do it that ' s for sure . just the box office alone the star wars franchise has brought in over $ 8 . 5 billion dollars !,4,3
TPCCHT-000022-5,agent_2,20th century fox did not think that star wars was going to succeed . do you know what happened to star wars ' licensing and merchandising rights ?,1,3
TPCCHT-000022-6,agent_1,didn ' t george lucas get them somehow ?,4,4
TPCCHT-000022-7,agent_2,"yes , because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to lucas .",4,4
TPCCHT-000022-8,agent_1,nice . he scored then big time because the entire star wars franchise is estimated to $ 65 billion dollars !,4,4
TPCCHT-000022-9,agent_2,"20th century fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $ 500k to lucas . they were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him . someone got fired at the company , i ' ll bet .",1,3
TPCCHT-000022-10,agent_1,you know it ! george lucas ' wife marcia won an academy award for editing the film !,4,3
TPCCHT-000022-11,agent_2,"i heard about it . she was talented . by the way , marcia is no longer married to lucas .",4,3
TPCCHT-000022-12,agent_1,whoa ! i didn ' t know that . maybe george doesn ' t have as much as that $ 65 billion as i thought . yikes .,2,2
TPCCHT-000022-13,agent_2,"it ' s okay . marcia is entitled to the money too . she want the award , remember ?",4,4
TPCCHT-000022-14,agent_1,yes ! lol james earl jones took only 2 . 5 hours to record all of the parts for darth vader for the original movie .,1,2
TPCCHT-000022-15,agent_2,"sorry , what i meant was "" she won the award "" . about james earl jones - i think he was only paid $ 7500 for his work . that was not fair .",4,3
TPCCHT-000022-16,agent_1,wow . that sure doesn ' t . i wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for darth vader ? on a different subject . . . . did you know that earth ' s surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land ?,3,3
TPCCHT-000022-17,agent_2,i did not know the exact percentages . thanks for the info !,4,4
TPCCHT-000022-18,agent_1,on a sad note relating to those percentages . . . . more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?,3,3
TPCCHT-000022-19,agent_2,i heard about it and we need to do something about it .,2,3
TPCCHT-000022-20,agent_1,i agree . it ' s sad . i had a good time chatting with you tonight !,4,3
TPCCHT-000022-21,agent_2,i thank you for your information - i learned a lot from you . have a good night .,4,3
